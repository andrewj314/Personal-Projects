# Personal-Projects
A grab-bag of machine learning, probability, and one-off projects I've worked on 

House Pricing Kaggle Competition: This was a Kaggle competition from July 2018. The idea was to take a dataset of 79 features relating to house information (lot frontage, number of bathrooms, roof type, neighborhood, etc) and predict the house price. I used a combination of Lasso regression and XGBoost and was able to crack the top 20% of competitors. I'm still working on improving this model in my "vast spare time" :)

Probability exercises: numerically checking my analytical solutions to a couple probability problems I found really interesting

tweet_dumper.py:
This was a quick favor to a friend - she's a PhD student at Penn writing her dissertation on Cold War monuments and how they shape national identity and national memory of the Cold War. She wanted a way to aggregate all tweets from a given user into an excel sheet for further analysis. I was able to use the tweepy scraping package to dump tweets from a bunch of different soviet-monument-themed twitter accounts (you really can find just about anything on the internet) into a csv/xls for her to use.

Keras forecasting:
Using Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (LSTMs) implemented via the Keras package to forecast google stock as demonstrated in this youtube video:

obviously was not particularly predictive but I learned a lot about Keras!


CU Prime talk:
This was a recruiting talk aimed at undergraduate physics majors. The goal was to convince undergrads to get into particle physics research and lure them to CERN with promises of cheese and skiing. As a result of this talk, I wound up supervising an undergrad who decided to do his summer research internship on my experiment

Thesis defense:
My PhD defense. Slightly more serious than the CU Prime talk (but with fewer pictures of cows)
