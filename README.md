A grab-bag of machine learning, probability, and one-off projects I've worked on 

House Pricing Kaggle Competition: This was a Kaggle competition from July 2018. The idea was to take a dataset of 79 features relating to house information (lot frontage, number of bathrooms, roof type, neighborhood, etc) and predict the house price. I used a combination of Lasso regression and XGBoost and was able to crack the top 20% of competitors. I'm still working on improving this model in my "vast spare time" :)

Probability exercises: numerically checking my analytical solutions to a couple probability problems I found really interesting

tweet_dumper.py:
This was a quick favor to a friend - she's a PhD student at Penn writing her dissertation on Cold War monuments and how they shape national identity and national memory of the Cold War. She wanted a way to aggregate all tweets from a given user into an excel sheet for further analysis. I was able to use the tweepy scraping package to dump tweets from a bunch of different soviet-monument-themed twitter accounts (you really can find just about anything on the internet) into a csv/xls for her to use.
