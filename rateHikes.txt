‘twas the night before rate hikes

And all through the floor

Not a trader was blinking

Their Bloombergs a-roar

 

The quant team was coding

(A typical sight)

Fearing bugs in their models

Would set them alight

 

The PMs were voicing

Their curvature views

All anxiously awaiting

Our dear Yellen’s news

 

When in through the door

With a crash and a thwack!

Came a jolly old banker

With a red coat and sack!

 

His beard and his boots

Screamed of longer duration

And we knew in a moment

He must be inflation

 

More jumpy than Bitcoin

His coursers they came

So bullish were they

As he called them by name:

 

“Now Carry! now Basis! now Value, Relative!

On Low Vol! on Gamma! on Credit Derivative!”

 

“I’ve come with a message

Of holiday cheer!”

Beamed the ruddy-faced chap

His breath reeking of [non-alcoholic egg nog.]

 

“With China so levered

And unemployment so shallow

Further rate tightening

The Fed just can’t swallow.”

 

“So enjoy your low rates

And your long-risk investing,

For the strength of this market

We’ll just have to keep testing.”

 

As he tore from Goliath

He looked back with a sneer

“Merry rate hikes to all

…but not ‘til next year!”
